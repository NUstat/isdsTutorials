## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading Sections 9.0 - 9.1 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-ds/9-sampling.html).

Once you are finished:

-   Click the 'grade tutorial' button at the top to retrieve your score.
-   Click the 'pdf' button to save the document as a pdf, you must have the tutorial open in a browser window for this button to work.
-   Submit the completed pdf to Canvas.


### Goals

-   Understand the Normal distribution, T-distribution and Chi-squared distribution, and when to employ each.
-   Describe modality and skewness of a distribution.
-   Understand and know when to apply the Empirical Rule.
