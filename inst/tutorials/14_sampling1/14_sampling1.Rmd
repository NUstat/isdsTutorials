## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading Sections 9.0 - 9.1 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-data-sci/09-sampling-distributions.html). Each question allows 3 'free' attempts. After the third attempt a 10% deduction occurs per attempt.

You can click the "View Grade" button as many times as you would like to see your current grade and the number of attempts you are on. Before submitting make sure your grade is as expected.


### Goals

-   Understand the Normal distribution, T-distribution and Chi-squared distribution, and when to employ each.
-   Describe modality and skewness of a distribution.
-   Understand and know when to apply the Empirical Rule.
