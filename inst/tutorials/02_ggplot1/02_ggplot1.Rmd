## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading Sections 2.0 - 2.3 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-data-sci/02-visualization.html). Each question allows 3 'free' attempts. After the third attempt a 10% deduction occurs per attempt.

You can click the "View Grade" button as many times as you would like to see your current grade and the number of attempts you are on. Before submitting make sure your grade is as expected.

### Goals

-   Understand the essential components of the Grammar of Graphics.
-   Create a scatterplot.
-   Describe a scatterplot.
-   Understand the different aesthetics.

## Exercise

Construct a scatterplot of `eruptions` by `waiting` using the `faithful` dataset by filling in the blanks (the data is already preloaded in R).

```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  ____
```

```{r Ex1-hint-1}
Common language: y by x
```

```{r Ex1-hint-2}
Make sure you open and close parenthesis after geom_point
```

```{r Ex1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r Ex1-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```

```{r Ex1-Q}
quiz(
  caption = "",
  question("Ex1Q1) Which of the following describes the relationship between eruptions and waiting? Check all that apply.",
           answer("Positive association",
                  correct = TRUE),
           answer("Negative association",
                  message = "Look at the trend going from left to right"),
           answer("No association",
                  message = "Are you sure?"),
           answer("Linear",
                  correct = TRUE),
           answer("Non-linear",
                  message = "Check the graph again."),
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE)
)
```
