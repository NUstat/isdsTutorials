## Application

The following applications use the `mcdonalds` dataset which has been preloaded for you. This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have not been removed and may need to be handled. See the "mcdonalds Data tab" for more information.

### Application 1

**Part 1**

Calculate the correlation between `calories`, `total_fat` and `carbohydrates`.

```{r App1a, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
cdc %>% 
  select(calories, total_fat, carbohydrates) %>% 
  cor(use = "complete.obs")
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 2**

Build a multiple linear regression model that predicts `calories` using `total_fat` and `carbohydrates`. Store the model and print the `summary()`.

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App1a"}

```


```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model <- lm(calories ~ total_fat + carbohydrates, data = mcdonalds)

summary(model)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 3**

Interpret the **intercept** in the context of the problem.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 2

**Part 1**

Build a **parallel slopes** multiple linear regression model that predicts `calories` based on `total_fat` and `category`. The variable `category` has 2 levels: {food, drink}.

Store the model as `model_calories` and print the `summary()`. 

```{r App2}
model_calories <- lm(calories ~ total_fat + category, data = mcdonalds)
```


```{r App2a, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App2a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
model_calories <- lm(calories ~ total_fat + category, data = mcdonalds)

summary(model_calories)
```

```{r App2a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 2**

```{r app2Q1}
question_dropdown(
  "App2 Q1) What is the baseline/reference level?",
  answer(c("drink"), correct = TRUE),
  answer(c("food")),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```

<br>

**Part 3**

Plot the relationship between `calories`, `total_fat`, and `category`. The code has been started for you. Recall the line of best fit for a parallel slopes model is created using the layer `geom_parallel_slopes()` 

Note: The "drink" line may be hard to see and that is okay. If you want to be able to see it better you can add `fullrange = TRUE` as an argument in the layer that created the line (but not necessary).

```{r App2b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App2"}
ggplot(mcdonalds, aes(x = , y = , color = )) +
  
```


```{r App2b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(mcdonalds, aes(x = total_fat, y = calories, color = category)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_parallel_slopes()
```

```{r App2b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

**Part 4**

Use `model_calories` to add the `fitted()` values to the `mcdonalds` dataset. Hint: remove NA values from the dataset and then add the fitted values. 

Print/output the results.

```{r App2c, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App2"}

```


```{r App2c-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
mcdonalds <- mcdonalds %>% 
  mutate(fitted = fitted(model_calories))
```

```{r App2c-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

### Application 3

Suppose that the amount of calories in a fast-food item is normally distributed with mean 600 and sd 100. 25% of food items have less than how many calories?

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```

- `calories_from_fat` 
- `total_fat` -- in grams (g)
- `saturated_fat`-- in grams (g)
- `trans_fat` -- in grams (g)
- `cholesterol` -- in milligrams (mg)
- `sodium` -- in milligrams (mg)
- `carbohydrates` -- in grams (g)
- `dietary_fiber` -- in grams (g)
