### Goals

-   Be able to perform multiple regression for two numerical explanatory variables.
-   Understand and interpret fitted values and residuals for multiple regression.
-   Understand the implications of grouping in data.


## Exercises

**Exercise 1:**

When creating the data frame credit_ch6, we renamed several variables as we selected them. First, fill in the blanks of the code that accomplished this. 


```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}
library(___)

credit_ch6 ___ Credit ___ 
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(debt = Balance, 
         ___ = Limit,
         ___ = Income, 
         credit_rating = ___ ,
         age = Age)
```


```{r Ex1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
library(ISLR)

credit_ch6 <- Credit %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  select(debt = Balance, 
         credit_limit = Limit,
         income = Income, 
         credit_rating = Rating,
         age = Age)
```

```{r Ex1-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```


**Exercise 2:**

Fill in the blanks for the code that creates the following plot.

```{r}
htmltools::img(src="images/Figure_06_1.png", height = 470, width = 410)
```


```{r Ex2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(credit_ch6, aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  geom____() +
  ___(x = ___, y = ___, ___ = "Debt and income") + 
  ___(method = ___, se = FALSE)

```

```{r Ex2-hint-1}
Part 2 Hint: Remember to include labels for the axes
```

```{r Ex2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(credit_ch6, aes(x = income, y = debt)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Income (in $1000)", y = "Credit card debt (in $)",
  title = "Debt and income") + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r Ex2-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```
