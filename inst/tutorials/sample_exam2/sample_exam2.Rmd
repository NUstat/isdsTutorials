## Instructions

You have 50 minutes to complete this exam. The exam covers the material learned from Chapter 5 - Section 9.1. You are allowed one page of notes front and back.

Once you are finished:

-   Make sure every question/exercise has been submitted.
-   Click the 'pdf' button to save the document as a pdf, you must have the exam open in a browser window for this button to work.
-   Submit the completed pdf to Canvas.


## Concept

You only need to type the letter of the solution in the textbox (ie: a, b, c, d, e). I strongly recommend playing it safe and writing down your answers on a piece of paper especially if you are a student who has experienced computer issues.

If one of your Concept answers does not submit manually enter the number followed by the answer (1. a, 2. b,etc...) in this box.

## Application

The following applications use the `mcdonalds` dataset which has been preloaded for you. This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have not been removed and may need to be handled. See the "mcdonalds Data tab" for more information.

### Application 1

**Part 1**

Calculate the correlation between `calories`, `total_fat` and `carbohydrates`.

```{r App1a, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 2**

Build a multiple linear regression model that predicts `calories` using `total_fat` and `carbohydrates`. Store the model and print the `summary()`.

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App1a"}

```

<br>

**Part 3**

Interpret the **intercept** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe1}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 2

**Part 1**

Build a multiple linear regression model with an **interaction** term that predicts `calories` based on `total_fat` and `category`. The variable `category` has 2 levels: {food, drink}.

Store the model as `model_calories` and print the `summary()`. 

```{r App2}
model_calories <- lm(calories ~ total_fat*category, data = mcdonalds)
```


```{r App2a, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

**Part 2**

```{r app2Q1}
question_text(
  "App2 Q1) What is the baseline/reference level?<br> <br>
  a) drink <br>
  b) food",
  answer(c("wrong"), correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  incorrect = "submitted"
  )
```

<br>

**Part 3**

Plot the relationship between `calories`, `total_fat`, and `category`. The code has been started for you. Then add the line of best fit for the interaction model. 

Note: The "drink" line may be hard to see and that is okay. If you want to be able to see it better you can add `fullrange = TRUE` as an argument in the layer that created the line (but not necessary).

```{r App2b, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App2"}
ggplot(mcdonalds, aes(x = , y = , color = )) +
  geom_point()
  
```

<br>

**Part 4**

Use `model_calories` to add the `residuals()` to the `mcdonalds` dataset. Hint: remove NA values from the dataset and then add the residuals. 

Print/output the results.

```{r App2c, exercise = TRUE, exercise.setup = "App2"}

```


## mcdonalds Data

You are welcome to open the dataset in RStudio Cloud as well if the information provided below is not sufficient for you.

This dataset provides a nutrition analysis of every menu item on the US McDonald's menu, including breakfast, beef burgers, chicken and fish sandwiches, fries, salads, soda, coffee and tea, milkshakes, and desserts.

Variables:

- `category` -- Binary variable with two options (food, drink)
- `item` -- Name of food or drink item
- `serving_size` -- serving size
- `calories` 
- `calories_from_fat` 
- `total_fat` -- in grams (g)
- `saturated_fat`-- in grams (g)
- `trans_fat` -- in grams (g)
- `cholesterol` -- in milligrams (mg)
- `sodium` -- in milligrams (mg)
- `carbohydrates` -- in grams (g)
- `dietary_fiber` -- in grams (g)
- `sugars` -- in grams (g)
- `protein` -- in grams (g)
