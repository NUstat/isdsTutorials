## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading Sections 2.4 - 2.6 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-data-sci/02-visualization.html). Each question allows 3 'free' attempts. After the third attempt a 10% deduction occurs per attempt.

You can click the "View Grade" button as many times as you would like to see your current grade and the number of attempts you are on. Before submitting make sure your grade is as expected.

### Goals

- Learn how to use and interpret a linegraph
- Learn to use and interpret a histogram
- Choose an appropriate number of bins for a histogram
- Use faceting to view plots by a category

## Exercises

**Exercise 1**

Fill in the blanks to construct a linegraph of `wind_speed` for early january. The dataset `early_january_weather` has already been pre-loaded in R.

```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = ___)) +
  ____
```

```{r Ex1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = wind_speed)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r Ex1-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```

**Exercise 2**

Consider the following plot.

```{r}
htmltools::img(src="images/Figure_02_6.png", height = 700, width = 700)
```

Fill in the code below to create this plot.

```{r Ex2, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
    ___(color = 'white') +
    ___(~ month)
```

```{r Ex2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = temp)) +
    geom_histogram(color = 'white') +
    facet_wrap(~ month)
```

```{r Ex2-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```

## Reading Quiz

```{r Q}
quiz(caption = NULL,
  # Q1
  question("Q1) What operator allows you to keep adding layers to a ggplot() object?",
           type = "learnr_text",
           answer("+", correct = TRUE),
           answer("plus", correct = TRUE),
           answer("plus sign", correct = TRUE),
           answer("the plus sign", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE),
    question("Q2) Which of the following are typically used to visualize the relationship between two numeric variables? Select all that apply.",
           answer("histogram"),
           answer("boxplot"),
           answer("scatterplot", correct = TRUE),
           answer("linegraph", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE), 
  # Q2
  question("Q3) What is the default number of bins R uses to build a histogram?", 
           type = "learnr_text",
           answer("30", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE),
    # Q3
    question("Q4) Which of the following arguments in geom_histogram() will make the inside (as opposed to the outline) of the bars blue?",
           answer(" bar = 'blue' "),
           answer(" shade = 'blue' "),
           answer(" color = 'blue' "),
           answer(" fill = 'blue' ", correct = TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE,
           random_answer_order = TRUE)
) 

```
