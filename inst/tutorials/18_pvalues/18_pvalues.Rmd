## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading Chapter 11 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-data-sci/11-p-values.html). Each question allows 3 'free' attempts. After the third attempt a 10% deduction occurs per attempt.

You can click the "View Grade" button as many times as you would like to see your current grade and the number of attempts you are on. Before submitting make sure your grade is as expected.


### Goals

-   Be able to define a null hypothesis.
-   Calculate p-values from test statistics.
-   Understand how to interpret p-values.
