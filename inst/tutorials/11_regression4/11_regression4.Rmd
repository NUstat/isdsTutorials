## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading Sections 6.2 - 6.4 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-data-sci/06-multiple-regression.html). Each question allows 3 'free' attempts. After the third attempt a 10% deduction occurs per attempt.

You can click the "View Grade" button as many times as you would like to see your current grade and the number of attempts you are on. Before submitting make sure your grade is as expected.

### Goals

-   Learn how to perform multiple regression for one numerical & one categorical explanatory variable.
-   Understand the difference between interaction models and parallel slopes models, and know when to use each model.
-   Understand Simpson's Paradox.


## Exercise

Fill in the blank for the code that produces the following plot:

```{r}
htmltools::img(src="images/Figure_06_3.png", height = 400, width = 700)
```

```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(evals_ch6, aes(x = ___, y = ___, color = ___)) +
  ____ +
  labs(x = ___, y = ___, color = ___) +
  ___(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r Ex1-hint-1}
Remember to include the parentheses for filling in the blank on line 2.
```


```{r Ex1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(evals_ch6, aes(x = age, y = score, color = gender)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Teaching Score", color = "Gender") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

```{r Ex1-check}
