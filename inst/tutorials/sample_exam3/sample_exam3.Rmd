## Application

The following applications use the `nc_births` dataset which has been preloaded for you. This dataset contains a random sample of birth records from all hospitals in North Carolina.

This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled. 

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (5 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining if the average birth `weight` of babies born in North Carolina for `smoker` is less than the average birth `weight` of babies born in North Carolina for `nonsmoker`. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the difference in `weight` for `smoker` and `nonsmoker`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe1}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```

### Application 2 (5 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining the proportion of babies that are born prematurely in North Carolina. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of babies that are `premie`.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe2}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


### Application 3 (7 points)

It is claimed that the national average weight of babies is 7.5 pounds at birth. Test to see if the average weight of babies born in North Carolina is equal to the national average of 7.5.

Conduct a hypothesis test for the weight at the $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level.

$$H_0: \mu_{weight} = 7.5$$
$$H_A: \mu_{weight} \ne 7.5$$

```{r App3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App-describe3}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```
