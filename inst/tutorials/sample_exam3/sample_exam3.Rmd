## Application

The following applications use the `nc_births` dataset which has been preloaded for you. This dataset contains a random sample of birth records from all hospitals in North Carolina.

This data has been pre-cleaned to remove any impossible observations. Missing values have **not** been removed and may need to be handled. 

<br>

**NA values should NOT be included in the total count (`n`) of a proportion because we do not know what category they would fall in and it would skew our proportion.**

<br>

If for some reason you are not able to complete the code to obtain the results it would be wise to still interpret your problem with 'placeholder' values for partial credit.

<br>

### Application 1 (5 points)

Suppose that the weight of a baby is normally distributed with mean 7.5 pounds and $\sigma$ = 0.25. 25% of babies are born below what weight?

```{r App1a, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r App1a-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qnorm(p = .25, mean = 7.5, sd = 0.25)
```

```{r App1a-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Suppose you are conducting a 90% confidence interval for a t-test with degrees of freedom = 24. What are the corresponding critical values? Note: there are 2 critical values.

```{r App1b, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r App1b-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
qt(p = .05, df =24)
qt(p = .05, df =24, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r App1b-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

### Application 2 (5 points)

Suppose we are interested in examining if the proportion of `female` babies that are born over 9 pounds is less than the proportion of `male` babies born over 9 pounds. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportion.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
nc_births |> 
  filter(weight > 9) |> 
  count(gender)

nc_births |> 
  count(gender)

prop.test(x = c(17, 44), n = c(503, 497))
```

```{r App2-check, exercise.diagnostics = FALSE}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

Interpret the **confidence interval** in the context of the problem. Is there a difference proportions?

```{r App2-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```

### Application 3 (5 points)

It is claimed that the national average weight of `female` babies is 7.5 pounds at birth. Test to see if the average `weight` of babies born in North Carolina with a `gender` of `female` is equal to the national average of 7.5.

Conduct a hypothesis test for the weight at the $\alpha = 0.01$ significance level.

$$H_0: \mu_{female-weight} = 7.5$$
$$H_A: \mu_{female-weight} \ne 7.5$$

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
nc_female <- nc_births %>% 
  filter(gender == "female")

t.test(nc_female$weight, mu = 7.5, conf.level = 0.99)
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```
<br>

State your p-value and interpret your decision in the context of the problem.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```


<!-- ### Application 2 (7 points) -->

<!-- Suppose we are interested in examining if the average birth `weight` of babies born in North Carolina for `smoker` is less than the average birth `weight` of babies born in North Carolina for `nonsmoker`. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the difference in `weight` based on `habit` (`smoker` and `nonsmoker`). -->
<!-- ### Application 3 (7 points) -->

<!-- $$H_0: \mu_{weight} = 7.5$$ -->
<!-- $$H_A: \mu_{weight} \ne 7.5$$ -->

<!-- ```{r App3, exercise = TRUE} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- <br> -->

<!-- question_text("", incorrect = "submitted", -->

<!--                      correct = TRUE), -->
