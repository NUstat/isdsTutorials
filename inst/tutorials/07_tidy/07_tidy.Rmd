### Goals

-   Understand what "tidy" data looks like.
-   Learn how to format data into "tidy" data.
-   Understand the main purposes of different packages.

## Importing data

Up to this point, we’ve almost entirely used data stored inside of an R package. Say instead you have your own data saved on your computer or somewhere online.

### 

Two common file types for data are `.csv` and `.xlsx` extensions.

### Exercise 1

To read in a `.csv` file we need the `readr` package.

### 

Use the `library()` function to load the **readr** package.

```{r importing-data-1, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r importing-data-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
library(...)
```

```{r importing-data-1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
library(readr)
```

```{r importing-data-1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2

The `.csv` file `dem_score.csv` is accessible on the web at "<https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv>".

Type `read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv")` to read in the file.

```{r importing-data-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r importing-data-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
read_csv(...)
```

```{r importing-data-2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv")
```

```{r importing-data-2-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

In order to use this data frame later, we need to **store** it in our **Environment**.

### Exercise 3

Before reading in the file type `dem_score <-` to name the dataset `dem_score`.

```{r importing-data-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r importing-data-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... <- read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv")
```

```{r importing-data-3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
dem_score <- read_csv("https://moderndive.com/data/dem_score.csv")
```

```{r importing-data-3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### 

Do NOT store the object as "dem_score.csv". Choose a name that is informative, yet easy to reference. Often times this can be the name of the file (without the extension type).

###

There is no output because we stored the data as an object.

### 

To get a better understanding of the data you could print the data by typing `dem_score` or use the `glimpse()` function.

### Exercise 4

The previous exercise showed how to read in a file from the web. However, most of the time you will be reading in data from you computer.

### 

Your project is known as your current working directory. Let's say you saved `dem_score.csv` in a `data/` sub directory within your project shown in the image below.

<center>

|  |  |  |
|--------------------------|:-----------------:|--------------------------|
| ![](images/folder_1.png){width="200"} | ➔ | ![](images/folder_2.png){width="200"} |

</center>

###

Within `read_csv()` we need to specify the file path of our data from our working directory. In this case `"data/dem_score.csv"`. 

Read in the file from the computer by typing `read_csv("data/dem_score.csv")`.

Store the file as `dem_score` using `dem_score <-` **before** read_csv. Then on the next line print the data by typing `dem_score`.

```{r importing-data-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r importing-data-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... <- read_csv(...)
dem_score
```

```{r importing-data-4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
dem_score <- read_csv("data/dem_score.csv")
dem_score
```

```{r importing-data-4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

Note that the `read_csv()` function included in the `readr` package is **different** than the `read.csv()` function that comes installed with R by default.

`read_csv()` is the preferred function and what that we will always use.

## Tidy data

In order to use the `ggplot2` and `dplyr` packages for data visualization and data wrangling, your input data frames must be in “tidy” format. So all non-“tidy” data must be converted to “tidy” format first.

### Exercise 1

Consider the following data frames that were created from the `drinks` data frame included in the `fivethirtyeight` package.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
drinks_smaller
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
drinks_smaller_tidy
```

###

```{r tidy-data-1}
question_wordbank("Match the name of the data frame with the format it is in.",
           choices = c("drinks_smaller", "drinks_smaller_tidy"),
           wordbank = c("wide format", "long format"),
           answer(c("wide format","long format"),correct=TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 2

A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types.

```{r tidy-data-2}
question_wordbank("Complete the following three statements that define tidy data.",
           choices = c("Each variable forms a _____.",
                       "Each observation forms a _____.",
                       "Each type of observational unit forms a _____."),
           wordbank = c("column", "row", "table"),
           answer(c("column", "row", "table"),correct=TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE)
```

### Exercise 3

Determine if the following tables are in tidy format.

```{r tidy-data-1}
  question_wordbank("",
           choices = c(paste0(htmltools::img(src="images/Figure_04_1_tidy.png", height = 175, width = 350) ), paste0(htmltools::img(src="images/Figure_04_2_nontidy.png", height = 75, width = 350) ), paste0(htmltools::img(src="images/Figure_04_3_tidy.png", height = 75, width = 350) ) ),
           wordbank = c("Tidy", "Not tidy"),
           answer(c("Tidy", "Not tidy", "Tidy"), correct=TRUE),
           allow_retry = TRUE)
```

## Case study: Democracy in Guatemala

The below code filters the `dem_score` data frame we imported in "Importing data" to only include the country Guatemala.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
guat_dem <- dem_score %>% 
  filter(country == "Guatemala")

guat_dem
```

### Exercise 1

Let’s produce a time-series plot showing how the democracy scores have changed over the 40 years from 1952 to 1992 for Guatemala.

###

In order to do that we need to tidy the data so that we have a `year` variable that we can put on the `x`-axis.

###

Start with `guat_dem` and pipe on `pivot_longer(cols = -country)`

```{r case-study-1, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r case-study-1-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
guat_dem %>%
  pivot_longer(...)
```

```{r case-study-1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
guat_dem %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country
  ) 
```

```{r case-study-1-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

This tidies all variables that are **NOT** country because we used the minus (-) symbol.

###

Notice the names of the new variables are `name` and `value. Those are not very informative or accurate variable names. 

### Exercise 2

Within `pivot_longer()` we can specify the new variable names with the `names_to` and `values_to` arguments. 

###

Copy the previous code and set the names to `"year"` and the values to `"democracy_score"` as follows: `pivot_longer(cols = -country, names_to = "year", values_to = "democracy_score")` 

```{r case-study-2, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r case-study-2-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
guat_dem %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country, 
    names_to = ..., 
    values_to = ...
    )
```

```{r case-study-2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
guat_dem %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country, 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "democracy_score"
  ) 
```

```{r case-study-2-check}
grade_this_code()
```


### Exercise 3

In order to reference or use this tidied data we need to store it. Copy the previous code and assign this new data to the name `guat_dem_tidy`.

Print the data after by typing `guat_dem_tidy` on the next line.

```{r case-study-3, exercise = TRUE}

```

<button onclick="transfer_code(this)">Copy previous code</button>

```{r case-study-3-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... <- guat_dem %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country, 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "democracy_score"
    )
guat_dem_tidy
```

```{r case-study-3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
guat_dem_tidy <- guat_dem %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -country, 
    names_to = "year", 
    values_to = "democracy_score"
  ) 
guat_dem_tidy
```

```{r case-study-3-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

Notice `year` is of type `chr` (character). 

### Exercise 4

If we were to plot `democracy_score` by `year` we would need `year` to be a numeric variable. To change the variable **type** we can use the `mutate()` function (Note: there is also a more advanced way to do this directly within `pivot_longer`). 

###

Start with `guat_dem_tidy` and pipe on `mutate(year = as.numeric(year))`

```{r case-study-4, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r case-study-4-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
guat_dem_tidy |> 
  mutate(...)
```

```{r case-study-4-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
guat_dem_tidy %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

```{r case-study-4-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

Within `mutate` we **overwrote** the variable `year` with a numeric version. In this case it is okay to overwrite the variable because we are not losing any information.

### Exercise 5

Copy the previous code and assign the new data frame to `guat_dem_tidy`. In other words overwrite the data frame.

```{r case-study-5, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r case-study-5-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
... <- guat_dem_tidy |> 
  mutate(...)
```

```{r case-study-5-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
guat_dem_tidy <- guat_dem_tidy %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year))
```

```{r case-study-5-check}
grade_this_code()
```

###

Again it is okay to **overwrite** our data frame because we are not losing any of the original information.

### Exercise 6

Now we can create the plot to show how the democracy score of Guatemala changed from 1952 to 1992 using a `geom_line()`.

###

Within `ggplot()` set the first argument equal to `guat_dem_tidy` and the second argument equal to `aes(x = year, y = democracy_score)`. Add on the appropriate geom layer with the `+` operator.

```{r case-study-6, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r case-study-6-hint-1, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(..., aes(x = ..., y = ...)) +
  geom_...()
```

```{r case-study-6-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(guat_dem_tidy, aes(x = year, y = democracy_score)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r case-study-6-check}
grade_this_code()
```
