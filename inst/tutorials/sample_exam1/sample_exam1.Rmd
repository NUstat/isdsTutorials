## Application

The following applications use the `cdc` dataset which has been preloaded for you. See the **CDC Dataset tab** for more information about the dataset

- **Important**: If you wrote more than the space provides, **after** you click submit. Put your mouse in the bottom right corner of the box and drag it down to make it longer (don't make it wider or it will cut off while printing).

### Application 1

Construct a side-by-side boxplot of `height` by `gender`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

Describe and compare the distribution, including center, spread, skew, and outliers.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 7)
```

### Application 2

For male survey participants, compute the count of men in each `genhlth` category. 

Then add a new variable called `proportion` which is equal to the `count/sum(count)`. Where `count` should be whatever you called your variable. 

Make sure you print/output your results.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```


### Application 3

Construct a barplot that shows the relationship of `gender` in each of the `genhlth` groups?

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```

Explain what the barplot tells us about the relationship between `genhlth` and `gender` for our respondents.

```{r App3-describe}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 7)
```

## CDC Data Codebook

Each variable corresponds to a question that was asked in the survey.

- `genhlth`, respondents were asked to evaluate their general health, responding either excellent, very good, good, fair or poor. 
- `exerany` variable indicates whether the respondent exercised in the past month (`1`) or did not (`0`).
- `hlthplan` indicates whether the respondent had some form of health 
coverage (`yes`) or did not (`no`). 
- `smoke100` variable indicates whether the respondent had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in her lifetime: `yes` they have or `no` they have not. 
- `height` respondent's height in inches
- `weight` respondent's weight in pounds
- `wtdesire` their desired weight
- `age` in years, 
- `gender` (recorded as `m` or `f`).

Glimpse the data

```{r}
glimpse(cdc)
```

Skim the data

```{r}
skim(cdc)
```
