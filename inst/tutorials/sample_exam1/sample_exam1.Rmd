## Application

The following applications use the `cdc` dataset which has been preloaded for you. .

```{r}

```

### Application 1

Construct a side-by-side boxplot of `height` by `gender`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```

Describe and compare the distribution, including center, spread, and shape/outliers.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```

### Application 2

For male survey participants, compute the count of men in each `genhlth` category. Create a new variable called `proportion` which is equal to the "count"/sum("count"). This depends on what your variable is called. Make sure you print/output your results.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```


### Application 3

What if we want to know the relationship of `gender` in each of the `genhlth` groups?

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```

Explain what the barplot tells us about the relationship between `genhlth` and `gender` for our respondents.

```{r App3-describe}
question_text("", incorrect = "submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 5)
```
