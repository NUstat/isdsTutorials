```


## Application

The following applications use the `cdc` dataset which has been preloaded for you. See the **CDC Dataset tab** for more information about the dataset

### Application 1

Construct a side-by-side boxplot of `height` by `gender`.

```{r App1, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = gender, y = height)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r App1-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Describe and compare the distribution, including center, spread, skew, and outliers.

```{r App1-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "Submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 7)
```

### Application 2

For male survey participants, compute the count of men in each `genhlth` category. 

Then add a new variable called `proportion` which is equal to the `count/sum(count)`. Where `count` should be whatever you called your variable. 

Make sure you print/output your results.

```{r App2, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App2-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
cdc %>% 
  filter(gender == "m") %>% 
  count(genhlth) %>% 
  mutate(proportion = n/sum(n))
```

```{r App2-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

### Application 3

Construct a barplot that shows the relationship of `gender` in each of the `genhlth` groups?

```{r App3, exercise=TRUE}

```


```{r App3-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(cdc, aes(x = genhlth, fill = gender)) +
  geom_barplot()
```

```{r App3-check}
grade_this_code(
  correct = "Submitted",
  incorrect = "Submitted"
)
```

Explain what the barplot tells us about the relationship between `genhlth` and `gender` for our respondents.

```{r App3-desc}
question_text("", incorrect = "Submitted",
              answer("ManuallyGradedEverythingWrong", 
                     correct = TRUE),
              allow_retry = TRUE,
              rows = 7)
```

## CDC Data Codebook

Each variable corresponds to a question that was asked in the survey.

- `genhlth`, respondents were asked to evaluate their general health, responding either excellent, very good, good, fair or poor. 
- `exerany` variable indicates whether the respondent exercised in the past month (`1`) or did not (`0`).
- `hlthplan` indicates whether the respondent had some form of health 
coverage (`yes`) or did not (`no`). 
- `smoke100` variable indicates whether the respondent had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in her lifetime: `yes` they have or `no` they have not. 
- `height` respondent's height in inches
- `weight` respondent's weight in pounds
- `wtdesire` their desired weight
- `age` in years, 
- `gender` (recorded as `m` or `f`).

Glimpse the data

```{r}
glimpse(cdc)
```

Skim the data

```{r}
skim(cdc)
```


## Submit

Once you are finished:

-   **No Name = 0 grade**
-   Click `View submissions` to check that all questions and exercises are **SUBMITTED**
-   Click the 'lock' button below. Once you click this you will not be able to make any changes to your exam!
-   Once the lock is pressed a `print` option will become available
-   Click print and submit the downloaded html to Canvas.

```{r}
exam_output_ui(id = "lock")
```

```{r}
lock_button_ui(id = "lock")
```


## Reset Exam

This button will reset the entire exam. This option will NOT be available for the actual exam. If your exam freezes and you need to use this please let me know so that I can fix any bugs prior to the exam. This is the first time this class is being held asynchronous so I anticipate bugs will occur during the exam.

```{r}
reset_button_ui(id = "reset", label = "Reset Exam")
