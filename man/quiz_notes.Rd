\description{
Add interactive notes to a tutorial. This is an alternative format to
display fill in the blank lines with smaller submit buttons for a
more fluid document then the boxed questions. This was adapted from
the learnr package quiz function. Many thanks to the learnr author
who developed a great and adaptable teaching tool.
